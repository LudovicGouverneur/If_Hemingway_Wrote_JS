The assignment: write a function that returns the factorial of the supplied argument.

For any positive integer n, the factorial of n is the result of multiplying n by all the positive integers of lesser value. So the factorial of 5, which is usually written as 5!, is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, or 120.

Someone clever once decided that 0! is 1, though no one can quite remember why. One explanation is that it keeps this pattern happy:
3! = 4!/4 2! = 3!/3 1! = 2!/2 0! = 1!/1

Based on that premise, −1! would be infinity, which is why mention of negative factorials tends to be accompanied by awkward coughing.
