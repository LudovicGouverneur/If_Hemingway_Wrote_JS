The assignment: write a function that returns all the prime numbers up to the value of the supplied argument.

A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by 1 and itself.  Thus, 2 and 3 are prime numbers, but 4 isn’t, because it’s
also divisible by 2. here are the  rst 15 prime numbers: 
> 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47

There are no known formulae for calculating the full distribution of prime numbers. at the time of writing, the largest known prime was (2^57,885,161)−1.  The electronic Frontier Foundation offers prizes for discovering very large primes.
