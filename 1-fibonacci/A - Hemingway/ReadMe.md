## Behaviour Study

### General

>NDLR : The objective of this step is to thoroughly understand the behavior of the studied function.

[See instruction]('./Behaviour)

> NDLR : Behavior is defined by inputs/output pairs.

Behaviour : returns the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

>The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers whereby each new number is the sum of the previous two. By convention, the first two numbers of the series are 0 and 1. These are the first 15 Fibonacci numbers:

> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377

>The sequence is named for Leonardo Pisano (also known as—wait for it—Fibonacci), but in a more just world, it would be named the Pingala sequence, after the Sanskrit grammarian who documented it a thousand years earlier.

>As we progress through the series, the ratio between successive numbers tends toward a constant (roughly 1.61803) known as the golden ratio. Some mathematically inclined ora arrange their branches or petals according to the golden ratio—though its prevalence in nature is sometimes overstated.

### Test-cases 
    * Create a whole lot of test cases in ./test/test-cases.js.
    
    * Be sure to test your test cases using the Repl.it.

    * The template indicates how you should structure your test cases.
