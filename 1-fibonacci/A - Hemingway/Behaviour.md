# Behaviour

>The objective of this step is to thoroughly understand the behavior of the studied function.

_Behavior is defined by inputs/output pairs._

Steps : 

a) Make a new repo, name it after your chosen function. Re-title the README.md in your template.

b) Copy the docs (if availabe) for your function into your readme.

c) Complete the Input Analysis section of the README (tables work well for this)

d) Test-cases 
    * Create a whole lot of test cases in ./test/test-cases.js.
    * Be sure to test your test cases using the Repl.it.
    * The template indicates how you should structure your test cases.
    * The tests written in this section, will be also used to pass the final script

e) Copy paste the source for your function into ./0-___.js. Be sure to line up the require statements.

f) Rename the 'require's in 0's testing file & run your test cases on the original  function. If any fail you are wrong. Fix your test cases.

> Done! You have now 100% understood the behavior of your function. Time to move on and study the implementation.
