The assignmenT: write a function that determines if the supplied argument is a happy number.

Take any positive integer, add the squares of its digits, rinse, and repeat. if you eventually reach 1, the original number is happy; otherwise, itâ€™s inconsolable.

here are a couple of examples:

___

19 is happy because
* 12 + 92 = 82
* 82 + 22 = 68
* 62 + 82 = 100 12 + 02 + 02 = 1

4 is unhappy because
* 42 = 16
* 12 + 62 = 37
* 32 + 72 = 58
* 52 + 82 = 89
* 82 + 92 = 145
* 12 + 42 + 52 = 42 42 + 22 = 20
* 22 + 02 = 4
* And the cycle repeats inde nitely . . .
